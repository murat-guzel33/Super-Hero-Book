# Super Hero Book

This project can be defined as a mobile application that introduces superheroes with a visual and text-based interface. This application, which runs on Android, allows users to switch between different superheroes by swiping and provides a title, features and an image for each hero.

## Features

- Swipe Superhero Gallery:
Horizontal Scrolling (Swipe): Users can switch between superheroes by touching and swiping the screen. This allows users to discover different heroes quickly and intuitively.
Animated Transitions: Thanks to the ViewPager2 component, smooth and fluid animated transitions are made between pages. This makes the user experience more impressive.
- Information Page for Each Hero:
Title and Details: Each page includes the name and short features of the selected superhero. Users can quickly learn basic information about the heroes.
Visual Presentation: Each superhero is presented with a distinct and eye-catching image. This allows users to more easily memorize the heroes in their visual memory.
- User-Friendly Interface:
Easy Navigation: The application is easy to use; users can access all superheroes with just a swipe. There are no complicated menus or buttons.

Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions. This allows users to have a comfortable experience on various devices (phone, tablet).
- Minimalist and Clean Design:
Organized and Understandable: The application interface is kept simple and organized so as not to disturb users. Users can access the information they want without any confusion.
Ease of Use: The design and functions of the application are simplified so that even users who are not familiar with technology can easily understand.
